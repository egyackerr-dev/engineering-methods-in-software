# Tips for Using and Maximizing One-Shot Prompts

All advice here is focused on getting the best results from one-shot-prompts.md.

1. **Use the full template, not a partial prompt.**  
   - Always copy the entire prompt from one-shot-prompts.md, including the requirements and instructions.

2. **Describe only the outcome/task you want – let the prompt enforce standards!**  
   - No need to write technical specs; the template ensures completeness, safety, and best practices.

3. **Adapt [LANGUAGE], [FULL_FILENAME], and [Brief description of your task] for fast results.**  
   - The placeholders allow for maximum flexibility with zero effort.

4. **Always demand Arabic comments for full clarity and easy review.**

5. **If worried about obscure input or future changes, lean on the template’s maintenance & expansion section.**

6. **Ask the model to provide extra self-tests or demo blocks directly in the script.**

7. **If in doubt, repeat “close all gaps proactively” in your description.**

8. **For high auditability, keep every script version, reference number, and changelog included.**

9. **If model output isn’t organized/numbered, remind it “Start every step/part with a reference number”.**
